# Flipkart Customer Support Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Flipkart’s customer support data to uncover key trends and insights. The goal is to enhance **customer satisfaction, optimize issue resolution processes, and improve overall service efficiency**.

By analyzing response times, customer feedback, escalation rates, and issue categories, this project identifies major bottlenecks in Flipkart’s customer support system and provides actionable recommendations.

##  Problem Statement
Flipkart is one of India’s leading e-commerce platforms, serving millions of customers daily. Despite its success, customer complaints and support inefficiencies can impact user experience and brand reputation. The project aims to:

- Analyze **common customer issues** and their frequency.
- Assess **resolution times and effectiveness** of customer support.
- Identify **escalation trends** and their root causes.
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve support operations.

##  Dataset Description
The dataset consists of customer service records, including complaints, resolutions, and CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) scores. The key columns in the dataset include:

- **Issue Reported At** – Type of issue reported by the customer.
- **Customer City** – Location of the customer.
- **Product Category** – Category of the purchased item.
- **Connected Handling Time** – Time taken to resolve the issue.
- **Agent Shift** – Shift during which the agent handled the complaint.
- **CSAT Score** – Customer feedback rating (1-5 scale).
- **Escalation Flag** – Indicator of whether an issue was escalated.

---

##  Objectives of the Analysis
- Identify the most **common customer complaints** and their distribution.  
- Understand **average resolution times** across different complaint categories.  
- Analyze **customer satisfaction trends** and factors influencing ratings.  
- Examine the **performance of customer support agents** based on response times and escalations.  
- Use insights to suggest **process optimizations** and customer experience improvements.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Steps Involved:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Converting data types.
   - Standardizing column names.

2. **Data Visualization & Storytelling**
   - **Bar Charts & Count Plots** – Understanding issue frequency across categories.
   - **Box Plots** – Analyzing resolution time distribution.
   - **Heatmaps** – Identifying correlations between customer satisfaction and support metrics.
   - **Trend Analysis** – Examining changes in complaint resolution over time.

##  Key Insights & Findings
**CSAT Score Distribution**
- Majority of customers provided **moderate satisfaction ratings (3-5 stars)**.
- Some customers rated support poorly due to **long response times and ineffective resolutions**.

**Issue Trends & Escalations**
- **Refund-related complaints** had the highest escalation rates, highlighting inefficiencies in return processing.
- **Damaged product complaints** also had longer-than-average resolution times.

**Agent Performance & Resolution Times**
- Experienced agents resolved complaints **faster and more effectively**.
- Certain shift timings (e.g., night shifts) had **higher resolution times**, indicating possible resource shortages.

**Complaint Resolution Trends Over Time**
- **Seasonal spikes** in complaints were observed during major sales events.
- Resolution efficiency **fluctuated** across months, possibly due to workload variations.

##  Recommendations & Business Impact
- **AI Chatbots for First-Level Support:** Automate common inquiries to reduce agent workload and response times.  
- **Process Optimization for Refunds & Returns:** Improve coordination between support and finance teams to expedite resolutions.  
- **Real-Time Agent Performance Monitoring:** Implement dashboards tracking response times, escalations, and CSAT scores.  
- **Predictive Analytics for Support Demand:** Forecast peak complaint periods (e.g., festival sales) to allocate resources efficiently.  
- **Multi-Channel Support Strategy:** Strengthen **WhatsApp, social media, and mobile app support** for faster resolutions.  

By implementing these improvements, Flipkart can **reduce customer dissatisfaction, enhance operational efficiency, and build long-term customer loyalty**.
